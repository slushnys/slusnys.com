# Promises
This promise I'm doing not for others but for myself. I haven't done much in a long time. Not in sense of accomplishments, but in sense of finished personal projects.
I had a lot of ideas of interesting tech startups. Varying from social platforms, through recipe websites to vlogs. 

It's sad, but all of them, which I started I haven't been consistent. I recognize that this is a mistake that people do very often and I'm glad I'm identifying this mistake earlier than later. For me being consistent is having discipline to push yourself to do things. e.g. write a blog post, go to the gym or find time to pursue your interests.

Consistency, lets call it for a change, is beating lazyiness out of yourself. Inconsistency for me personally is being pure lazy.
